## Tag Hider for CodeForces

The extension adds a button to toggle on/off problem tags on codeforces

The rating tag (difficulty tag) is considered separate and is marked as a spoiler (see the image below) and can be toggled on/off independently of problem(topic) tags

[Link to the script](https://github.com/vishalagrawal22/tag-hider-codeforces/raw/main/script.user.js)

You will need a userscript manager like [Tamper Monkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to use the script

For the script to work properly, please note that "show tags for unsolved problems" should be **OFF** in your general setting on codeforces
